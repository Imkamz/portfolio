      <p className='text-center'>Aspiring software developer from London</p>
      <p className='flex py-5'>I am a career-minded A-Level student with a GSCE record of good grades in different subjects. I work hard on assignments and
        consistently meet objectives. I want to gain experience outside of a classroom and build foundational knowledge and skills. I am
        also energetic with a balanced background in academic and extra-curricular activities. I am diligent about preparing for
        examinations, competitions and assignments. My peers, teachers and classmates, consider me reliable and responsible with
        good communication and relationship-building abilities. I am a quick learner with academic abilities and technical knowledge to
        succeed in different roles. I am ready to expand horizons with additional knowledge and abilities gained from training and
        experience. I will always be ready to help others and use abilities to support team goals.</p>
