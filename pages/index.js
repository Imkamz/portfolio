      <h1>Kamari Lee</h1>
      <p className='text-center'>Aspiring software developer from London</p>
      <p className='flex py-5'>Since my childhood, I have always had an interest in computers which drove me to pursue a career in IT. Even in my early years, when coding enabled me to create trivial games on scratch, I found it appealing, and this fascination was enhanced as I saw how I could apply computer science in society. I am driven to persistently gain more knowledge, understanding and expertise in this area as most of its aspects tend to change continuously absolutes the disposition of such a career.

                               By my own effort, and working under one of experienced coder, I have engaged with several programming coding including: JavaScript, HTML, Java and Python to name a few. These languages have been essential in many projects, each language being a step toward my journey of becoming technically skilled. One of the most interesting and thought-out projects was my portfolio website, which presented my work and future plans in software development. On that site, I showcased features such as a random number generator, a calculator, a dice roller, a rock paper scissors game and several other applications. These projects helped me improve my coding skills as well as acquire an understanding of the significance of technology in the real world. My exploration of Java, through the development of a 2D platformer game, was crucial in solidifying my programming mindset. This experience taught me the importance of flexibility, perseverance, and problem solving skills essential in the fast-paced world of technology.

                               Working at the Customer Service Department of Transport for London (TFL) gave me an insight into the practical side of technology. This experience included following employees while they assisted customers and addressed technical problems, as well as altering schedules of employees using TFL's interface for altering schedules. Computer systems about business processes often illustrated the need for usability and reliability. My work here also demonstrated quite how important communication, resolving issues and collaboration are â€“ all of which are an integral part of the industry I want to work in.

                               In line with my passion for technology, I have pursued knowledge in computer science and have gained some practical experience to complement my studies. As I pursue my course, I look forward to enhancing my skills further and playing an active part in the creation and resolution of challenges in the ever-evolving IT world. It is not only about acquiring knowledge in this field but more about equipping one to play his or her role in making the technological revolution of tomorrow.</p>
